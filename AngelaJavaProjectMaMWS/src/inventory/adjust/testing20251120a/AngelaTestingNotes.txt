

Test on VDI.

Put message on queue by calling my test API.
Project: MaWMS_CommonLIB_tester
API: PutMsgOnQueue.msgflow


Results look good.

Modified "Input_PIX_message.json".  The catch weight value needs to be a decimal value, not integer.

Successful test.  Catch weight is now in the correct format.
'0000000.00'
